# Cost-effective IT

**Cost-effective IT** is the strategic use of technology resources to achieve objectives at minimal cost while maintaining acceptable quality and performance.

In simple terms:
👉 Get the most benefit from IT for the least money spent.

## What it usually involves

* Right-sizing infrastructure
Using servers, cloud resources, and licenses that match actual needs (not over- or under-provisioned).

* Open-source and free tools
For example: Linux, Nginx, PostgreSQL, WordPress instead of expensive proprietary software when appropriate.

* Automation
Scripts and tools (bash, Ansible, CI/CD) to reduce manual work, errors, and labor costs.

* Efficient maintenance
Standardized setups, good logging, monitoring, and documentation to reduce downtime and support effort.

* Cloud vs on-prem balance
Choosing cloud services only when they’re cheaper or more flexible than running your own servers.
