Here’s a **clean, reusable prompt** you can copy-paste whenever you want ChatGPT to refactor a script to **your installer template standard**.

This is written to be **unambiguous and enforceable**.

## ✅ **Template Compliance Prompt**

> Refactor the following Bash script to fully comply with my installer template standards.
>
> **Mandatory requirements:**
>
> 1. **Logging**
>
>    * Create a timestamped log file named using the script purpose
>      (example: `LOGPATH=$(realpath "<name>_install_$(date +%s).log")`)
>    * All command output must be redirected to this log.
> 2. **info_msg helper**
>
>    * Implement an `info_msg()` function that prints messages to stdout **and** appends to the log using `tee -a "$LOGPATH"`.
>    * All user-visible messages must go through `info_msg`.
> 3. **Functions only**
>
>    * Every installation step must be implemented as its **own function**.
>    * No direct execution of install logic outside functions.
> 4. **Progress reporting**
>
>    * Each step must be announced using `info_msg` with numbered progress format:
>      `[x/y] <description>`
>    * The corresponding function must be executed with:
>
>      ```bash
>      function_name >> "$LOGPATH" 2>&1
>      ```
> 5. **Save-this-info section**
>
>    * End the script with a clearly labeled summary section.
>    * Must include:
>
>      * Installed version (if applicable)
>      * Access URL(s)
>      * Credentials (if generated)
>      * Install paths
>      * Systemd service names (if created)
>      * Log file location
>
> **Additional constraints:**
>
> * Preserve existing functionality and behavior.
> * Do not remove safety checks or prompts.
> * Do not introduce external dependencies unless already used.
> * Script must remain copy-paste runnable.
>
> Here is the script to refactor:
>
> ```bash
> <PASTE SCRIPT HERE>
> ```

## 🧠 Why this works

* Forces **structure**, not “best effort”
* Prevents partial compliance
* Preserves behavior
* Produces ADR-quality installers every time

If you want, I can also give you:

* a **short version**
* a **strict CI-style version**
* or a **role-author prompt** for contributors

Just tell me.
