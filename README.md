## Intro

**ADR (Auto-Deploy Role)** is a Linux automation tool that helps you deploy services **quickly, consistently, and with minimal effort**.

Instead of manually installing packages, editing configuration files, and securing services step by step, ADR lets you deploy complete service roles using **a single command**. Each role takes care of installation, configuration, and sensible defaults so you can focus on using the service, not setting it up.

ADR is inspired by PowerShell’s `Install-WindowsFeature`, bringing the same **one-command, repeatable deployment experience** to Linux.

Whether you are managing servers, running a homelab, or automating deployments, ADR makes service deployment faster and more reliable.

### Features

* **One-command role deployment**
  Deploy services like WordPress, GLPI, or BookStack with a single command.

* **Modular roles**
  Each role is self-contained and handles installation, configuration, and basic security.

* **Repeatable and consistent**
  Get the same results every time, across different systems.

* **Linux-focused**
  Designed specifically for Linux servers and common deployment scenarios.

* **Automation-friendly**
  Easy to use interactively and easy to integrate into scripts or automation pipelines.

### Benefits

* **Save time** by avoiding manual setup and troubleshooting
* **Reduce complexity** with clear, predictable deployments
* **Repeatable results** across systems and environments
* **Faster service delivery** from fresh system to running service
* **Safer defaults** with built-in configuration and best practices
