**ADR (Auto-Deploy Role)** provides modular Linux deployment roles inspired by Windows PowerShell’s `Install-WindowsFeature`.

With simple commands like:

```bash
adr zabbix
adr wordpress
```

you can automatically **install, configure, and secure** services on Linux systems. ADR simplifies Linux service deployment, making it fast, consistent, and repeatable.
